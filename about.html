          <h3>PuppyHood - Saving India's Street Dogs</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Millions of stray dogs live on the streets of India. Most are direct
            descendants of their feral canine ancestors, a "breed" much older
            than any AKC (American Kennel Club) breed. With the recent increase
            in popularity among Indians of full breed dogs, more and more street
            dogs are abandoned pets or have bred with pet breeds.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Although they are widely feared because some carry rabies, for the
            most part India's street dogs are not aggressive and will only bite
            if provoked. Indeed, many are fearful of humans and sadly, the dogs'
            fears are well founded.<br /><br /><br />

            India's street dog population is closely associated with municipal
            sanitation practices – or neglect thereof. Because these homeless
            dogs often survive by scavenging rubbish, exposed garbage means more
            healthy dogs – and more puppies. Ironically, this actually makes the
            dogs a boon to public sanitation. By scavenging garbage, they reduce
            perishable waste that could otherwise be a source of contamination
            for people. And their presence around garbage keeps away other
            potentially dangerous scavengers, such as rats and mice..

            <b>PuppyHood</b> channels your donations to both well-established
            and emerging Indian animal protection groups who confront daunting
            obstacles every day in their mission to rescue, shelter and fight
            for the rights of animals. We work closely with these groups and
            vouch for their courage, compassion and determination. Our guidance
            helps them improve their missions and operations so they can
            maximize their effectiveness as advocates for and defenders of the
            animals of India .
